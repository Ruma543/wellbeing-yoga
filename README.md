   by selecting from service cards that match their interests.

   Without logging in, they won't be able to view the service details.Once a
   user successfully logs in, they will be directed to their desired page.

3. If a user is not registered on the website, they must complete the
   registration process first. If any errors occur during registration, a
   notification or alert, such as a "sweet alert," should be displayed to inform
   the user about the issue.

4. After logging in, the user's name and image should be displayed in the
   website's navigation bar for a personalized experience.

5. The "Event" and "Contact" pages are marked as private, which means they are
   only accessible after a user logs in. Once logged in, these pages should be
   visible in the navigation bar, and users can access them.
